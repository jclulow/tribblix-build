Building gfx-drm

1. Use a standard illumos-build zone (or instance). Need
TRIBdiagnostic-scanpci installed, as we need headers from that. The
ilumos-build overlay now contains it.

2. Check out the repo

git clone https://github.com/illumos/gfx-drm
cd gfx-drm

3. Edit myenv.sh

sed -i s:DCFlnpr:Cnpr: myenv.sh
echo "export SUPPRESSPKGDEP=true" >> myenv.sh

4. To package, we need validate_pkg from somewhere

sed -i s:@validate_pkg:/opt/onbld/bin/validate_pkg: usr/src/pkg/Makefile

5. Tribblix doesn't ship the tests, so remove them

rm usr/src/pkg/manifests/system-test-libdrm.mf

6. Just run

/usr/bin/ksh93 tools/bldenv myenv.sh "cd usr/src ; make setup"
/usr/bin/ksh93 tools/bldenv myenv.sh "cd usr/src ; make install"
/usr/bin/ksh93 tools/bldenv myenv.sh "cd usr/src/pkg ; make install"

7. Convert the packages

Must be run on an illumos-build zone, but can be run as a user,
doesn't have to be root.

${THOME}/tribblix-build/repo_all.sh \
  -G /export/home/ptribble/Illumos/gfx-drm \
  -D /var/tmp/gfx-pkgs \
  -R drm \
  -S /export/home/ptribble/f/elfcert >& /var/tmp/gfx.log

OmniTribblix wants a different package version (with the lx in it), so
we have to duplicate all the packages.

${THOME}/tribblix-build/repo_all.sh \
  -G /export/home/ptribble/Illumos/gfx-drm \
  -D /var/tmp/omni-gfx-pkgs \
  -V 0.21lx.0 \
  -R drm \
  -S /export/home/ptribble/f/elfcert >& /var/tmp/gfx.log

8. The packages should be delivered by the illumos repo, so copy the
packages (*.zap*) into the relevant illumos package directory so as to
amalgamate them with the packages from a gate build.
